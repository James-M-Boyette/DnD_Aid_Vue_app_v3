# Capstone 3.0 Notes

## Why redo this project?

At a basic level, my project functioned, but had multiple stylistic bugs. Moreover, it was my first app - so of course I barely understood the frameworks I was implementing.

Redoing this project afforded me the opportunity to learn and further-cement my understanding of JavaScript, Vue, Bootstrap, general Frotend concepts (such as 'props' and 'data binding'), and HTML/CSS.

## What problems was I trying to solve?

- [ ] I wanted to fix styling bugs:

  - I'd mashed together a basic webpage template (which, unbeknownst to me, used jQuery), some Bootstrap 4, multiple CSS declarations (inline, in seperate style sheets, and even in the head), and the result was a rats-nest of code that seemed more trouble to fix than simply re-doing things from scratch with my now-seasoned understanding.

- [ ] I wanted to make these fixes quickly:

  - I actually love taking my time, diving deep into a project, and really squeezing everything I can out of the process - noodling upon noodling in order to get the most satisfying product out that I can. But I've also learned that many good ideas come two days after you've put the project down (rather than in hour 14 of non-stop work).
  - I also know that speed is an important skill for almost any job I land going-forward.
  - As a result, this was a great opportunity to both learn tools (like frontend and style frameworks) and strengthen habits that would allow me to be faster while I strive for good work product.

- [ ] I wanted to refresh my familiarity with Rails server architecture and interactions (logging in/out, making requests, etc.)

## What technologies was I trying to learn?

- [ ] I wanted to use a

  - My Vue app was built over the course of three weeks, as I tried to follow my boot camp instructor's demonstrations. I was completely confused, lacking a basic understanding of nearly everything we were doing! ðŸ¤£ I made it work, and this is an accomplishment in itself. But questions like "Why does Vue structure its apps in 'x' way? What are my opinions on 'best practices' for proper modularization of an app?" or "How is the user's input being stored? How are we managing 'state' (and what even _is_ 'state')?"
